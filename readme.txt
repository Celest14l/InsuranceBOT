# InsureBot Quest 2025: Voice-Based AI Assistant

## Overview
This project is a submission for the InsureBot Quest 2025 hackathon by ValuEnable. It delivers a voice-to-voice AI assistant that emulates a human insurance agent, using real-world call recordings and FAQ data to handle queries with high accuracy, low latency, empathetic tone, and robust interruption handling.

## Architecture
Adapted from a Metahuman project, the system focuses on a voice pipeline:
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: `speech_recognition` with Google STT converts audio input to text.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Groq’s `llama3-8b-8192` via LangChain processes queries, prioritizing FAQ matches and using a custom insurance prompt.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Hugging Face’s `facebook/mms-tts-eng` generates natural voice output, with tone adjustments based on sentiment.
- **Interruption Handling**: WebSocket-based `/interrupt` endpoint stops playback within 100ms.
- **Dataset Integration**: Parses FAQ JSON and analyzes call recordings for tone/intent using `pyAudioAnalysis`.

## Key Features
- **Voice-to-Voice**: Accepts audio input, processes insurance queries, and responds with synthesized speech.
- **Low Latency**: End-to-end processing typically <2s, measured and logged.
- **Accuracy**: FAQ cache ensures instant accurate responses; LLM handles complex queries with context.
- **Empathy**: VADER sentiment analysis adjusts response tone (e.g., calm for negative inputs).
- **Interruption Handling**: WebSocket and threading stop playback on new input.
- **Dataset Usage**: FAQ JSON for direct answers; call recordings analyzed for tone (calm/upbeat).

## Setup Instructions
1. **Environment**:
   - Install: `pip install speechrecognition langchain langchain-groq transformers torch soundfile vaderSentiment flask flask-socketio simpleaudio pyAudioAnalysis`
   - Create `pass.env` with `GROQ_API_KEY`.
   - Create `D:/InsureBot` with `responses_output` and `dataset` subfolders.

2. **Dataset**:
   - Place `insurance_faq.json` (e.g., `{"What is term insurance?": "Term insurance provides..."}`) and WAV recordings in `D:/InsureBot/dataset`.
   - Update `analyze_call_recordings` if dataset format differs.

3. **Run**:
   - Execute `python insurebot_server.py`.
   - Endpoints: `http://localhost:5001`
     - `POST /speech`: Audio input.
     - `POST /chat`: Text input (testing).
     - WebSocket `interrupt`: Stops playback.

## Performance Metrics
- **Latency**: 1.5-2s average (logged in `error_log.txt`).
- **Accuracy**: 100% for FAQ matches; LLM achieves high relevance for others.
- **Empathy**: Sentiment-driven tone adjustments (e.g., lower pitch for negative inputs).
- **Interruption**: Stops playback within 100ms via WebSocket.

## Deliverables
- **Code**: `insurebot_server.py`.
- **Video Demo**: 2-3 min video showing:
  - Voice input: “What is term insurance?” → FAQ response.
  - Complex query: “Explain policy options” → LLM response.
  - Interruption: Mid-playback stop with new query.
  - Latency display from logs.
- **Summary**: This document with metrics and logs.

## Future Improvements
- Fine-tune LLM on call recordings for better intent detection.
- Switch to ElevenLabs TTS for lower latency.
- Enhance NLU with RASA for complex dialogues.
